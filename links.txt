Ronald and Jim Locke What, indeed, is more romantic than this wandering
life of rhetorician and student that the youthful Augustin led, from

DESCRIPTION

LibriVox - founded in 2005 - is a community of volunteers from all over
the world who record public domain texts: poetry, short stories, whole
books, even dramatic works, in many different languages. All LibriVox
recordings are in the public domain in the USA and available as free
downloads on the internet. If you are not in the USA, please check your
country's copyright law before downloading.

Please visit the LibriVox website <http://librivox.org/> where you can
search <http://librivox.org/search> for books that interest you. You can
search or browse by title, author, genre, language or reader (and,
though not yet fully developed, by keyword), and you can look for all
solo recordings by a particular reader, or their contributions to group
recordings.

Our goal is to make all public domain books, in any language, available
as free audiobooks. Would you like to help us to reach our goal? We
always welcome new readers, prooflisteners, cover artists, or simply
suggestions for books to read.

If you would appreciate suggestions for books to listen to, check out
our monthly feature /the staff picks/ where on the first day of each
month, 10 books from the catalog are highlighted. You can find the list
for this and the previous months on our blog
